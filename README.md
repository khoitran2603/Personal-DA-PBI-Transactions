# Introduction

### About the Project
This project analyses my personal bank transactions from January to August 2025 to evaluate whether I am living below my means ‚Äî that is, whether my monthly spending consistently stays within my income.

### The Question
‚ÄúIf I earn around $4,000 per month, do I live below my means ‚Äî or do my expenses exceed what I make?‚Äù

This report answers that by looking at monthly cash flow ‚Äî how much money came in, how much went out, and whether I ended each month in surplus or deficit.

Rather than aiming for investment or savings targets, the focus here is cash behaviour realism ‚Äî how money actually flows through daily life, influenced by events, convenience, and commitments.

### Project Challenge
Personal finance data is often **unstructured, inconsistent, and event-driven**, making meaningful analysis difficult.
My biggest challenge was to **standardise multiple bank exports** (ANZ, Westpac, etc.) into one consistent dataset and classify transactions that mix essentials (rent, utilities) with one-off events (travel, car insurance).

  <table>
    <tr>

        <em>Westpac raw dataset</em>
      </td>
      <td align="center">

        <em>ANZ raw dataset</em>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</p>

Therefore, instead of focusing on daily precision, I built a system designed for monthly accuracy, allowing me to observe realistic spending trends while accepting small timing delays in transaction posting.

# Project Building Summary (SQL)

- Merge multiple bank formats (ANZ, Westpac) into one unified dataset.
- Clean and normalise descriptions, removing card numbers and repeated prefixes.
- Automatically classify categories using pattern matching (e.g., ‚ÄúAPPLE.COM‚Äù ‚Üí Entertainment).
- Extract locations from text strings by matching against a Melbourne suburb dictionary.

## Income vs Expense Overview
(Linked to Visual 1: Monthly Income vs Expense Trend)

- Over 8 months, my total spending ($33,285) nearly equals my total income ($33,230), leaving a small deficit of -$55.
- While most months' expenses stayed below income, overspending would happen on occasion, for instance, from March-April, I spent approximately 25-45% more than my income for family travel and hosting when they come from overseas to visit. 

üü¢This indicates tight balance control, in which I am essentially living within my means when not influenced by special events.
  
## Cash Flow Over Time
(Linked to Visual 2: Cumulative Net Cash Flow)

This chart tracks how my cash position evolved over eight months.
- The cumulative balance rose early in the year and reached its highest point in February ($1,536), then dipped sharply and reached its lowest point in May (-$3,000) before recovery onward.
  
"This shows strong control where short-term overspending doesn't create long-term imbalance."

- Even with high fluctuations but minor, the cumulative line ends still close to zero, confirming that I operated at or slightly below my means, with no sustained deficit.

## Spending Structure & Flexibility
(Linked to Visual 3: Expense Composition ‚Äî Doughnut Chart)

To evaluate whether I‚Äôm living below my means, I grouped my spending into four structural types:

|**Type**|**Flexibility**|**Description**|
| :- | :- | :- |
|Fixed|None|Rent, utilities, subscriptions - unavoidable costs.|
|Semi-fixed|Low|Vehicle, groceries - somewhat controllable.|
|Flexible|High|Eating out, entertainment, retail - lifestyle-driven.|
|Other|Varies|New or irregular categories.|

- More than half of my budget is locked into predictable commitments, creating a reliable financial base cost.

üéØThe flexible cost (27%) is the deciding factor in whether I live below my means. It represents my lifestyle and choice-driven spending.

- By trimming flexible costs by just 5-10%, I could ensure a consistent extra ~$100 per month without affecting essential comfort.

## Flexible Spending Breakdown
(Linked to Visual 4: Category Deep-Dive ‚Äî Bar Chart)

Within flexible costs:
- Eating Out accounts for the largest share (39%), made by medium and frequent purchases (106 transactions)
- Fun & Vacation (26%) appears as one-time spikes (March-April)
- Retail Shopping (21%) follows, reflecting weekend and social spending

üçî Most flexible spending ties to convenience or social activities, not impulsive luxury.

Visual 4 highlights how small daily choices (fast food, coffee, short outings) collectively influence whether I stay below my means. This visibility turns ‚Äúoverspending‚Äù into precise, measurable, and adjustable.

## Location Patterns
(Linked to Visual 5: Location-Aware Map)

Inner Melbourne (Melbourne + Southbank), Local Suburb (Caulfield), and Workplace Suburb (Springvale) are where I spent most of my money, which reflects how I live:
- **Inner Melbourne (CBD)**: Mainly on weekends, mostly for eating at restaurants, parking, and retail shopping such as clothes, electronics, and home furniture. 
- **Local Suburbs**: Over 80% spend on groceries for everyday needs, eating out (15%) mostly for fast food + convenience tied to daily walking habit.
- **Workplace Suburb**: For lunch break eating and after-work groceries.

Visual 5 shows that high-spend areas align with planned or convenient locations, not random or wasteful ones

üó∫Ô∏è Location spending validates behaviour logic ‚Äî even flexible spending is practical.

## Key Takeaways
1. **Housing dominates** at 43%, anchoring spending every month.
2. **Car costs were irregular but heavy** (insurance + plate renewal), not everyday fuel.
3. **Family visits** explain the sharpest spikes in March‚ÄìApril.
4. **Daily convenience** (fast food, local shops, subscriptions) shaped much of the flexible spending.
5. With a small net deficit (‚Äì$55), reducing flexible spend by 10‚Äì15% would easily bring me back into surplus.

# Conclusion
This project transformed eight months of personal transactions into clear spending insights. By cleaning, categorising, and automating the data in SQL, I uncovered how fixed costs anchor my budget while events and convenience choices shape the rest. It showed how real-life financial data can tell meaningful stories ‚Äî and how small adjustments, like reducing flexible costs, can quickly improve stability.
