## About the Project
This project applies data analytics techniques to my own bank transactions for the period from January to August 2025.

The goal is to analyze spending behavior, identify patterns and anchors, and present findings in a clear, professional dashboard/report format.

It demonstrates how personal finance data can be transformed into insights â€” useful both for self-management and as a showcase of my data storytelling skills in a portfolio.

  <em>Fig. 2: Spending by Categories</em>
</p>

- Income: $33,230
- Expenses: $33,285
- Net Position: â€“$55 (covered by savings, no debt impact)
- Categories: 14 | Sub-categories: 67
- Top 3 Categories: Housing (43%), Motor Vehicle (11%), Eating Out (11%) â†’ 65% of all spending

ðŸ‘‰ Insight: Spending is anchored by housing, with lifestyle costs forming the second tier.

## Trends & Shifts
- Income steady at ~$3,800/month
- Expenses spiked in March (family trip flight) and April (hosting family visit).
- Average spend per purchase declined from $71 â†’ $47, showing a move toward more frequent, smaller transactions.

ðŸ‘‰ Insight: Family events explain the biggest deviations in an otherwise stable pattern.

## Spending Structure
- Fixed: 51% (housing, utilities, subscriptions)
- Semi-fixed: 20% (car + groceries)
- Flexible: 27% (eating out, entertainment, shopping, vacations)
- Other: 3% (new categories)

ðŸ‘‰ Insight: Over half of my budget is locked, but flexible areas still leave room for control.

## Where I Spend It
- CBD: 13% of Eating Out (restaurants, weekends) and 48% of Retail Shopping (clothes, electronics).
- Suburb (Caulfield + Malvern East): 11% of Eating Out (fast food + convenience during daily walks).
- Motor Vehicle: 10% on fuel (Oakleigh/Tottenham), 6% on CBD parking.

ðŸ‘‰ Insight: Location reflects lifestyle: CBD = leisure/social, Suburb = routine, Oakleigh/Tottenham = travel/social.

## Key Takeaways (Jan-Aug 2025)
1. Housing is the dominant anchor (43%).
2. Family visits explain the sharpest expense spikes.
3. Routines (daily walks, car use) strongly shape spending distribution.
4. A minor deficit (â€“$55) highlights stability, but a limited buffer â€” reducing 10â€“15% flexible spend would restore surplus.
